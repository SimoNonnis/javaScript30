// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

// with Objects
const person = {
  name: 'Simon Nonnis',
  age: 40
};

// and think we make a copy:

// how do we take a copy instead?

// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
